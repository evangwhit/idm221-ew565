Dave Whitaker has been writing about music for over 14 years. Starting in 2009, he began *Dave’s Music Database* to collect, consolidate, and promote music-related *best-of* lists. The blog has amassed more than 5 million hits and the accompanying Facebook page has fans in more than 40 countries. He has authored more than twenty books, music-related and otherwise, and has written a music column for PopMatters.com entitled “Aural Fixation.” He spends his time now running a Classic Albums Meetup group since 2029 and currently records episodes for the Dave’s Music Database podcast.

Launched in June 2021, the podcast now airs via Spotify and has reached listeners in over 100 countries. Episodes typically key in on one of the best-of lists connected to the blog, offering exclusive insight into highlighted songs from the lists.

Dave’s books accumulate statistics from dozens of historical music charts to find the aggregate ranking of the top 100 songs in a specific domain. His charts have covered music from the 1800’s all the way up until 2019. He is currently working on the top 100 songs of the pre-recording era.

### Top 100 Songs of the Digital Era

**Image_2**

In the 21st century, people dramatically changed how they accessed and listened to music. Physical singles and albums gave way to downloading. Streaming services and YouTube replaced terrestrial radio and MTV as methods for discovering new music.The era produced some of the longest-running chart-toppers in the history of recorded music. Lil Nas X’s “Old Town Road,” Luis Fonsi’s “Despacito,” Mark Ronson & Bruno Mars’ “Uptown Funk!,” Black-Eyed Peas’ “I Gotta Feeling,” and Mariah Carey’s “We Belong Together” spent 14 weeks or more on top of the Billboard Hot 100.Almost half the songs in this book rank in the top 100 best-sellers of all time. Nearly a third place in the top 100 most-watched videos ever. 18 won Grammys for Record and/or Song of the Year. All 100 represent the 21st century’s new digital era of music.

### Top 100 Songs of the Rock Era

In April 2011, I published my first Dave’s Music Database book – The Top 100 Songs of the Rock Era, 1954-1999. In celebration of the 10th anniversary, I am prepping a new edition of the book. In addition to integrating more lists, this edition reflects the effect of streaming and online video on even the pre-digital era. Newer sales data and more charts have been incorporated. Awards given to songs have been updated. 17 new songs make appearances on the list. You can see both the new list and the original list below. Click on song titles to access their DMDB pages.

Check out the five-part podcast counting down all 100 songs on Spotify, premiering June 29, 2021 and running every Tuesday (7pm CST) through July 27, 2021.

### Top 100 Albums of the All Time

Ah, the music list. Music journalists love to create them and fans love to shred them. However, by aggregating hundreds of best-of lists, Dave’s Music Database has stripped away subjectivity in favor of cold, hard numbers. Commentaries about the albums consolidate the views of multiple experts instead of serving up single opinions. It all makes for one definitive, inarguable best-of-all-time list. Okay, maybe not – but here’s hoping you’ll find value in this list, even if that’s in dissecting, disagreeing, debating, or debunking it. Rock on and read on.

Songwriters and big bands and barbershop quartets ruled. Broadway and sheet music drove popularity, not YouTube and Spotify. However, a perusal of most “best songs of all time” list suggests music didn’t exist prior to the rock era. This book remedies that problem by focusing exclusively on the music before Elvis Presley and the Beatles - the works of songwriters such as Irving Berlin and George M. Cohan and musicians like Bing Crosby, Glenn Miller, and Al Jolson. Compiled from sales figures, and chart data, and hundreds of best-of lists, these are the best songs of roughly the first half of the 20th century.

The book *Top 100 Albums of All Time* was published by Dave’s Music Database in 2014. It aggregated more than 150 best-of lists from all manner of music publications and entities and crunching those figures into a database along with sales figures, chart results, critical ratings, and various awards.

The book only featured one album from the 21st century (Eminem’s The Marshall Mathers LP) and, frankly, if I were to revise the book I’d refocus it just on the 20th century. Either way, this book serves as a sequel, keying in on the top 100 albums of the 21st century.

### Reviews

“These lists are always open to opinion. But when they are based on a database as extensive as the one used by Dave Whitaker, opinion has great authority. This tenth edition not only includes 100 songs, but also those that appeared in the first one.”

“The author has an interesting method of compiling his "Top 100" list. He kind of "averages" out a number of things to make his determination of what belongs where on his list. Not just his opinion of what he likes, but sales / critical reviews / chart action / and airplay, all come into consideration.”

“Dave himself in the introduction alludes to the fact that "some of us are freaks who didn't mind writing term papers." He's obviously only referring to himself. Well, I for one enjoyed reading his "post" term paper and will refer to it often. My only criticism is that he didn't include an index so I can easily look and see if the word Marillion appears anywhere.”

“These types of publications tend to err on the side of subjectivity, but the author uses such a number of sources that his opinion must be considered more than respectable. Even the comments that accompany each album are written based on credible quotes.”
