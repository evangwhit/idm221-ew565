# About Me

**Headshot.jpg**

I was born in a one-room log cabin in the backwoods of Kentucky in the late 1940s. My family had no electricity or running water. As the ninth of 12 children, I chopped wood and played with the family’s jug band on the front porch.

As a teen, I headed to Memphis, Tennessee with dreams of entering the music industry. I was a custodian at Sun Records when Elvis Presley came in to record. By the 1960s, I was in New York doing backstage work for the Ed Sullivan Show. I rigged lighting the night the Beatles performed.

I was a roadie with Led Zeppelin in the 1970s. In the 1980s, I was a gopher at Epic Records’ studios when Michael Jackson recorded Thriller. By the 1990s, I was getting coffee for directors on video shoots, most notably Nirvana’s “Smells Like Teen Spirit.”

I also have some swampland in Florida to sell you.

My less interesting, but accurate, life story is that of a lifelong suburbanite born in 1967 in Des Moines, Iowa. I was raised primarily in Kansas City, Missouri where I developed strong interests in listening to music and writing, but never exhibited the slightest talent for creating music.

I spent my work life in the childcare field as a trainer, consultant, and resource developer. I have authored over 20 books, some related to work, some to music (WritbyWhit.com). I’ve also written for the Library of CongressNational Recording Registry and PopMatters.com (the column “Aural Fixation”). In 2009, I started the Dave’s Music Database blog. It has more than 5 million hits and its accompanying Facebook page has fans in over 40 countries. I moderate a Classic Albums Meetup group since 2019 and launched the Dave’s Music Database podcast in 2021.

### Top 100 Songs of the Digital Era

**digital.jpg**

In the 21st century, people dramatically changed how they accessed and listened to music. Physical singles and albums gave way to downloading. Streaming services and YouTube replaced terrestrial radio and MTV as methods for discovering new music.The era produced some of the longest-running chart-toppers in the history of recorded music. Lil Nas X’s “Old Town Road,” Luis Fonsi’s “Despacito,” Mark Ronson & Bruno Mars’ “Uptown Funk!,” Black-Eyed Peas’ “I Gotta Feeling,” and Mariah Carey’s “We Belong Together” spent 14 weeks or more on top of the Billboard Hot 100.Almost half the songs in this book rank in the top 100 best-sellers of all time. Nearly a third place in the top 100 most-watched videos ever. 18 won Grammys for Record and/or Song of the Year. All 100 represent the 21st century’s new digital era of music.

### Top 100 Songs of the Rock Era

**rock-era.jpg**

In April 2011, I published my first Dave’s Music Database book – The Top 100 Songs of the Rock Era, 1954-1999. In celebration of the 10th anniversary, I am prepping a new edition of the book. In addition to integrating more lists, this edition reflects the effect of streaming and online video on even the pre-digital era. Newer sales data and more charts have been incorporated. Awards given to songs have been updated. 17 new songs make appearances on the list. You can see both the new list and the original list below. Click on song titles to access their DMDB pages.

### Top 100 Albums of the All Time

**all-time.jpg**

Ah, the music list. Music journalists love to create them and fans love to shred them. However, by aggregating hundreds of best-of lists, Dave’s Music Database has stripped away subjectivity in favor of cold, hard numbers. Commentaries about the albums consolidate the views of multiple experts instead of serving up single opinions. It all makes for one definitive, inarguable best-of-all-time list. Okay, maybe not – but here’s hoping you’ll find value in this list, even if that’s in dissecting, disagreeing, debating, or debunking it. Rock on and read on.

### Top 100 Songs of the Pre-Rock Era

**pre-rock.jpg**

Songwriters and big bands and barbershop quartets ruled. Broadway and sheet music drove popularity, not YouTube and Spotify. However, a perusal of most “best songs of all time” list suggests music didn’t exist prior to the rock era. This book remedies that problem by focusing exclusively on the music before Elvis Presley and the Beatles - the works of songwriters such as Irving Berlin and George M. Cohan and musicians like Bing Crosby, Glenn Miller, and Al Jolson. Compiled from sales figures, and chart data, and hundreds of best-of lists, these are the best songs of roughly the first half of the 20th century.

### Top 100 Albums of the 21st Century

**albums21.jpg**

The book *Top 100 Albums of All Time* was published by Dave’s Music Database in 2014. It aggregated more than 150 best-of lists from all manner of music publications and entities and crunching those figures into a database along with sales figures, chart results, critical ratings, and various awards.

The book only featured one album from the 21st century (Eminem’s The Marshall Mathers LP) and, frankly, if I were to revise the book I’d refocus it just on the 20th century. Either way, this book serves as a sequel, keying in on the top 100 albums of the 21st century.

### Content

Most posts on Dave’s Music Database are presented without personal commentary. This one is an exception. 1985 likely marked the most significant year of my life in terms of growth and discovery. I graduated from high school and headed to college. My sheltered upbringing was challenged as I learned to co-exist with people with vastly different backgrounds and lifestyles. I wouldn’t have had it any other way.

Similarly, my musical tastes would undergo a significant awakening. For my first 18 years I gravitated largely toward pop music. In grade school and middle school, I bought eight tracks of adult contemporary staples like Air Supply, John Denver, Neil Diamond, and Barry Manilow. By high school, my tastes leaned a bit more toward rock with Foreigner, Journey, REO Speedwagon, and Styx. However, in college I started listening to the heavier rock I’d previously snubbed my nose at – Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, and Rush.

My greatest discovery, though, was a band practically no one in America had heard of – Marillion. My local album-rock station played just enough of the song “Kayleigh” to get me curious. The song didn’t break any new ground with its failed-love theme, but it explored the idea with some of the best lyrics I’d ever heard:

>Do you remember chalk hearts melting on a playground wall -
Do you remember dawn escapes from moon-washed college halls -
Do you remember the cherry blossom in the market square -
Do you remember I thought it was confetti in our hair -
By the way didn’t I break your heart? -
Please excuse me, I never meant to break your heart -
So sorry, I never meant to break your heart -
But you broke mine

Fish did date a woman named Kay Lee, but said the song was a composite of several “deep and meaningful relationships that basically I’d wrecked because I was obsessed with the career and where I wanted to go.”WK It was an apology to some of the women he’d dated.WK While the song went largely unnoticed in the U.S., its #2 peak in the UK gave rise to the popularity of the name there.WK

I loved the song even if American radio didn’t. Several times I picked up the cassette of the song’s parent album, Misplaced Childhood,, in Camelot music store and pondered the fascinating cover art done by Mark Wilkinson of a young boy, barefoot and in a military uniform. I knew nothing about this group. Was it worth taking a risk? The answer was a resounding yes. When I finally took the leap I discovered a neo-progressive rock group from England helmed by a singer and lyricist nicknamed Fish. “Kayleigh” was the centerpiece of a concept album about the downfall of the protagonist because of his failed relationship and difficulty in coping with fame. In the end, his rediscovery of the innocence of childhood leads to his rebound.

I found out this was the band’s third album, which led me to delve into their back catalog. “Kayleigh,” Misplaced Childhood, and Marillion became my all-time favorite song, album, and group. I didn’t “break up” with what some considered immature musical tastes; instead I celebrated the music of my childhood even as I discovered new directions in adulthood. It became the philosophy that has governed my music appreciation ever since.
