                I was born in a one-room log cabin in the backwoods of Kentucky in the late 1940s. My family had no electricity or running water. As the ninth of 12 children, I chopped wood and played with the family’s jug band on the front porch.

                As a teen, I headed to Memphis, Tennessee with dreams of entering the music industry. I was a custodian at Sun Records when Elvis Presley came in to record. By the 1960s, I was in New York doing backstage work for the Ed Sullivan Show. I rigged lighting the night the Beatles performed.

                I was a roadie with Led Zeppelin in the 1970s. In the 1980s, I was a gopher at Epic Records’ studios when Michael Jackson recorded Thriller. By the 1990s, I was getting coffee for directors on video shoots, most notably Nirvana’s “Smells Like Teen Spirit.”

            <p>I also have some swampland in Florida to sell you.</p>

                My less interesting, but accurate, life story is that of a lifelong suburbanite born in 1967 in Des Moines, Iowa. I was raised primarily in Kansas City, Missouri where I developed strong interests in listening to music and writing, but never exhibited the slightest talent for creating music.

                I spent my work life in the childcare field as a trainer, consultant, and resource developer. I have authored over 20 books, some related to work, some to music (WritbyWhit.com). I’ve also written for the Library of CongressNational Recording Registry and PopMatters.com (the column “Aural Fixation”). In 2009, I started the Dave’s Music Database blog. It has more than 5 million hits and its accompanying Facebook page has fans in over 40 countries. I moderate a Classic Albums Meetup group since 2019 and launched the Dave’s Music Database podcast in 2021.
